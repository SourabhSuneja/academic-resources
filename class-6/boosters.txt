Excel is a popular spreadsheet program that helps us organise and analyse data.

Excel stores data in a table-like grid having "rows" and "columns". 

Rows are horizontal lines marked by numbers. Columns are vertical and marked by letters. 

Excel helps us to organise data quickly. It also allows us to perform calculations on data. 

A complete Excel file is a workbook and different "pages" in the workbook are called worksheets. 

You can think of a workbook like a notebook, and worksheets like the pages of that notebook.

A cell is a rectangular box formed by the intersection of a row and column.

A group of cells selected together is called a range.

We can enter data in cells. The data can be text, numbers and formulas.

Each cell has a unique address and it can be used to refer to that cell when creating a formula. Example, A1, A2, etc.

A formula is an equation that we use to perform calculations in Excel. For example: =A1+B1

The Autofill feature of Excel allows us to fill cells with data automatically based on a pattern. Example, automatically filling the names of months (Jan, Feb etc) or writing roll numbers (1, 2, 3 etc).

Undo is used to reverse the last performed action, whereas redo is used to repeat the action which was undone.
