//A number system is a way of representing quantities.
//The different types of number systems are: Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal number systems.
//The number of digits present in a number system is called the base of that number system. 
//The base of the binary number system is 2 while that of the decimal number system is 10.
//To convert a decimal number into its binary form, we divide the number by 2.
//The binary number system is important because it's the only number system that a computer understands.
//Any crime committed with computers or the internet is called a cybercrime. Examples: hacking, phishing, spamming etc.
//Cyber security means taking all measures and precautions to protect yourself from cybercrimes.

A chart is an effective way to display data in a pictorial form.
Excel allows us to create different kinds of charts to better understand data: Column chart, bar chart, pie chart, line chart etc.
The chart area includes the entire chart, including titles and legends, whereas the plot area is the section where the actual data is shown with bars, lines etc.
The titles given to the X-Axis and Y-Axis are called axis titles.
The data values on the basis of which a chart is plotted are called "data series".
Sparklines are mini charts that fit into a single cell to show data trends at a glance.
A combo chart is a combination of two or more charts.
The sort feature of Excel helps you arrange the data either in ascending or descending order.
Python is a very popular programming language used to create computer programs and software.
Python is very easy to learn and user-friendly.
Python programs are written in the IDLE environment.
The IDLE environment can work in 2 different modes: Interactive mode and Script mode.
In the interactive mode, commands are written and executed one by one. You write a command, press the Enter key and get its ouput immediately on the next line.
In the script mode, the entite program is written as one single file and then saved. The program is run by pressing the shortcut key F5.
In Python, operators are symbols which are used to perform different operations on operands, such as addition, subtraction etc.
The operators used to perform basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, division etc) are called arithmetic operators.
