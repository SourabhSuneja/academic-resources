A number system is a way of representing quantities.
The different types of number systems are: Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal number systems.
The number of digits present in a number system is called the base of that number system. 
The base of the binary number system is 2 while that of the decimal number system is 10.
To convert a decimal number into its binary form, we divide the number by 2.
The binary number system is important because it's the only number system that a computer understands.
Any crime committed with computers or the internet is called a cybercrime. Examples: hacking, phishing, spamming etc.
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage.
Examples of cyber attacks include hacking, phishing, spamming, identity theft, cyberbullying etc.
Hacking is the unauthorized access to someone else's computer to exploit or manipulate data.
Phishing is an attack in which the attacker sends a fake email to trick people into giving their personal information. The mail looks authentic but it's actually not.
Cyberbullying is using the internet to harass, threaten, or harm someone.
To protect yourself from cybercrimes, i) Never click on links from unknown people, ii) Use strong passwords, and iii) Keep your antivirus updated.
A strong password is long, unique, and includes a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. It should not have guessable patterns like 123, abc etc.
