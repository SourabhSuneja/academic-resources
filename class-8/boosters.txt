//Primary data is collected for the first time. Example: population census by the government.  
//Secondary data is previously collected data that can be used by others.  
//Machine learning teaches computers to learn from data patterns and make decisions on their own.  
//Data filtering removes unwanted elements, like blank values, from data.  
//Clustering means grouping data based on feature similarities.  
//Quantitative data is expressed in numbers. Example: height, number of students.  
//Qualitative data describes qualities and can't be expressed numerically. Example: honesty, beauty.
//An outlier is an object that is odd one out.
//Population of a region is considered as discrete data, because it is "counted".
//Regression predicts future trends based on past data.
//A shopkeeper analyzing past sales to decide next month's stock is a real-life example of data science.
//E-commerce websites use data science to analyze customer behaviour and recommend products for future purchases.
//Data science isn't always accurate, as predictions can sometimes be wrong due to incomplete or misleading data.
//Cricket teams use data science to analyze player performance and develop strategies for upcoming matches.
//Banks use data science to check credit risk and detect fraud.
//Data science is important because it helps us make better decisions by finding useful information in data.
//Do you know even IPL teams use data science to select best-performing players? Factors like strike rate, and hard-hitting ability are considered for choosing best batsmen.
//Discrete data is always "counted" in whole numbers while continuous data is "measured", and may have decimal values as well.


//Data visualisation means representing data graphically so that it can be easily understood.

//Data can be visualised through a variety of techniques: charts, graphs, maps etc.

//Maps are used to represent geographical information, like what places are located where.

//Charts can be of different types: pie chart, line chart, column chart, bar chart etc.


//A pie chart displays data in the form of a circle. It represents compositions and proportions of a whole.


//A line chart is a graph with lines showing changes over time. Suitable for analysing trends over time.


//A column chart is a chart with tall bars going up and down to show different values.


//A heatmap is a data visualisation technique that uses colors to show how much or how little something is happening in different areas. For example, a heatmap can show how crowded different areas of a park are, with red for busy spots and blue for quiet ones.


//Data visualisation is important because it helps us understand and see patterns in information quickly.


//It's important to have good quality data for any kind of analysis.

//Quality data must be accessible, clear to understand, relevant, accurate and available on time.


//Regression is a method to find relationship between two variables and predict one on the basis of another.

//In regression, the variable that we are trying to predict is called the dependent variable, and the variable which affects the dependent variable is called the independent variable. Example: consider a relationship between the number of hours you study and the marks you score. Your marks are a "dependent" variable because they depend on the number of hours you study. The hours studied are the "independent" variable.

//Cohort analysis is a way to study how different groups of people behave over time.

Data Science is a field that has applications in many different areas, including e-commerce, banking, education, healthcare, agriculture and more.
E-commerce companies use data science to understand their customers and recommend products accordingly. It also helps them analyse product reviews.
In education, data science can be used to analyse student performance, assess teachers' skills and for career guidance.
Banks use data science for fraud detection, checking who is eligible for loans and credit cards and for designing saving schemes for different customers. They also use data science for predicting loan recoveries.
In healthcare, data science is used to improve patient care, diagnose diseases, and find better treatment options.
Apps like Uber use data science to figure out the closest driver to pick you up quickly and the best route to get you where you want to go.
The ability of computers and other devices to understand our spoken words is called speech recognition.
Speech recognition makes it possible for us to give commands to a computer or phone simply by speaking.
Speech recognition also helps people with disabilities to type easily.
Some examples of apps that use speech recognition are Alexa, Siri, Cortana etc.
Text data analytics is a field that teaches computers to extract, read and understand lots of text!
Text data analytics is mainly used to analyse "unstructured" text data - data which is scattered in different places and has no proper structure.
With text data analytics, companies can create AI programs that can automatically read product reviews and analyse what products are most liked by the customers.
Text data analytics involves 3 things: Data Mining, Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval.
Data mining means digging through a big pile of data, and identifying hidden patterns and useful information.
Natural Language Processing is an AI field that teaches computers to understand and generate human languages on their own.
Information Retrieval means teaching computers to find the right information from a huge collection and answer our questions quickly.
Image Data Analytics is a field that teaches computers to process images and figure out what is inside them on its own!
Several apps use image data analytics: Google Lens, TapTapSee, LeafSnap, Calorie Mama etc.
