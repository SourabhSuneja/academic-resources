//Clustering
//Forming groups on the basis of feature similarities. E.g. putting all "red" colour objects together.

//Machine Learning
//Teaching computers to learn from sample data and become capable of taking decisions on their own.

//Data
//Any raw facts, figures or concepts that can be communicated.

//Information
//Data which has been processed to obtain something meaningful.

//Quantitative Data
//Data which can be expressed in numbers. E.g. height, number of students etc.

//Qualitative Data
//Data which cannot be expressed in numbers. E.g. honesty, beauty etc.

//Discrete Data
//Data which is "counted" in whole numbers like 0, 1, 2, 3 and so on. E.g. number of students in a class.

//Continuous Data
//Data which is "measured" and may also have decimals. E.g. weight (47.5 kg), length (156.2 metres).

//Anomaly Detection
//Finding data points which are significantly different from other normal points. E.g. a transaction of Rs. 20 lakhs in a bank account that usually sees transactions in the thousands.

//Data Science
//A field that uses data for making intelligent decisions. 

//Outlier
//An object that is different (odd one out) from other objects in the group.
