         <h1>Arranging and Collecting Data - Q&A</h1>
         <h2>Short Answer Type Questions</h2>
         <p><strong>1. Why data needs to be collected?</strong></p>
         <p>Data is collected to <strong>analyze, understand, and make decisions</strong> based on facts instead of guesses.</p>

         <p><strong>2. What is the impact of improper data collection?</strong></p>
         <p>Improper data collection can lead to <strong>wrong conclusions, wasted resources, and poor decision-making</strong>.</p>

         <p><strong>3. How does data collection software work?</strong></p>
         <p>Data collection software works by <strong>gathering, storing, and organizing</strong> information automatically through forms, sensors, or online tools.</p>

         <p><strong>4. My book on "Data Science" got 4.5 star rating? Which type of variable is this?</strong></p>
         <p>This is an <strong>ordinal variable</strong> because ratings show order (1 star is less than 4.5 stars).</p>

         <p><strong>5. What is the amount of data in bytes over which a data set is called big data?</strong></p>
         <p>A dataset is called <strong>Big Data</strong> when it is too large (in <strong>terabytes or petabytes</strong>) to be handled by traditional software tools.</p>

         <p><strong>6. What are the five V's of Big Data?</strong></p>
         <p>The five V’s are: <strong>Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity</strong>, and <strong>Value</strong>.</p>

         <h2>Long Answer Type Questions</h2>
         <p><strong>1. Distinguish between three types of data variables.</strong></p>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Nominal:</strong> Categories without order (e.g., colors: red, blue, green).</li>
            <li><strong>Ordinal:</strong> Categories with order (e.g., star ratings: 1 star, 2 stars, 5 stars).</li>
            <li><strong>Interval/Ratio:</strong> Numerical data with meaningful values (e.g., height, weight, temperature).</li>
         </ul>

         <p><strong>2. What are the two data collection methods? Distinguish between them.</strong></p>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Data:</strong> Collected first-hand through surveys, interviews, or experiments. It is <strong>original and reliable</strong> but costly.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Data:</strong> Collected from <strong>already available</strong> books, articles, or reports. It is <strong>easy and cheap</strong> but may not be fully accurate.</li>
         </ul>

         <p><strong>3. What are the different methodologies used for data collection and analysis? Describe any one of them in detail.</strong></p>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Interviews</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Surveys</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Questionnaires</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Case Studies</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Focus Group Discussions</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Smart Gadgets & Devices</strong></li>
         </ul>
         <p><strong>Example - Surveys:</strong> A survey collects data by asking structured questions to a large group of people. It is <strong>quick, cost-effective</strong>, and helps in studying patterns.</p>

         <p><strong>4. What are the advantages of focus group discussion?</strong></p>
         <ul>
            <li>Provides <strong>in-depth opinions</strong> from participants.</li>
            <li>Encourages <strong>group interaction</strong> and idea sharing.</li>
            <li>Helps in <strong>understanding consumer behavior</strong>.</li>
            <li>Useful in <strong>testing new products or ideas</strong>.</li>
         </ul>

         <p><strong>5. How does social media data affect human life?</strong></p>
         <p>Social media data impacts life by shaping <strong>opinions, advertisements, political campaigns, and even personal decisions</strong>. It can help connect people but also spread misinformation.</p>

         <p><strong>6. What are the techniques used in interpretation and analysis of consumer data?</strong></p>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Data mining:</strong> Finding hidden patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Statistical analysis:</strong> Using averages and trends.</li>
            <li><strong>Predictive analysis:</strong> Guessing future behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Using charts and graphs to explain data.</li>
         </ul>

         <p><strong>7. What are the three distinct ways to find relationship among data?</strong></p>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Correlation:</strong> Shows relationship between two variables (e.g. Is there any relationship between the number of hours you study and your exam scores?)</li>
            <li><strong>Regression:</strong> Predicts values using relationships. (e.g. if I score 7 marks by studying for 1 hour, how much will I score if I study for 2 hours?)</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-tabulation:</strong> Compares variables in tables. (e.g. comparing prices of one company's products with another company's)</li>
         </ul>

         <p><strong>8. What are multivariate data conditions utilised for in research?</strong></p>
         <p>Multivariate data conditions are used when <strong>more than two variables</strong> are studied together. They help researchers understand <strong>complex relationships, patterns, and predictions</strong> in fields like healthcare, marketing, and education.<br>For example: If a reasearcher wants to find out what influences weight gain or loss, he will look at <strong>multiple variables</strong> such as, one's diet, exercise schedule, hours of sleep etc. Studying just one variable will not give a true picture because weight is influenced by many variables.</p>

      <h2>Extra Questions</h2>
               <p><strong>1. How does NASA use data science?</strong></p>
         <p>NASA uses data science to <strong>study space missions, predict weather, monitor satellites</strong>, and make safe decisions for astronauts.</p>

         <p><strong>2. How does Sourabh Sir's marks management app use anomaly detection to catch data entry errors?</strong></p>
         <p>The app compares a student’s <strong>new score</strong> with past scores and scores in other subjects. If the new score looks very different, it is <strong>flagged as unexpected</strong> so the teacher can check it again.</p>

         <p><strong>3. How do F1 cars use sensors and data science? How does it help?</strong></p>
         <p>F1 cars have <strong>hundreds of sensors</strong> that track speed, tire temperature, fuel, and engine health. This data helps teams <strong>improve performance, plan pit-stops, and ensure safety</strong>.</p>

         <p><strong>4. Give an example of a classification algorithm that asks repeated Yes/No questions to solve a real-life problem.</strong></p>
         <p>A <strong>Decision Tree</strong> works like this. Example: To decide if you can play outside – it asks <strong>Is it raining?</strong> (Yes/No), then <strong>Is it too hot?</strong> (Yes/No), and so on until a final decision is made.</p>
